Jennifer Usrey-Scott

Jennifer recently moved from Washington to Houston for the warm weather and the UT Houston Coding Bootcamp.
Jennifer’s extensive professional and educational background spans from hospitality to accounting and has led her to pursue her newest passion, full-stack web development. 
It all started when Jennifer worked for the state of Washington and received funding to create a web based program with developers.
If she’s not teaching herself how to crochet or spending time with her dogs Pandora & Gizmo, she is exploring and learning the newest technologies in programming. 
“I enjoy all of the parts especially the back-end of development, my favorite is when you get that code working right and you go, ‘oooh!’”
